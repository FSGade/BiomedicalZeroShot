    The automatic extraction of chemical information from text requires the
    recognition of chemical entity mentions as one of its key steps. When
    developing supervised named entity recognition (NER) systems, the
    availability of a large, manually annotated text corpus is desirable.
    Furthermore, large corpora permit the robust evaluation and comparison of
    different approaches that detect chemicals in documents. We present the
    CHEMDNER corpus, a collection of 10,000 PubMed abstracts that contain a
    total of 84,355 chemical entity mentions labeled manually by expert
    chemistry literature curators, following annotation guidelines specifically
    defined for this task. The abstracts of the CHEMDNER corpus were selected
    to be representative for all major chemical disciplines. Each of the
    chemical entity mentions was manually labeled according to its
    structure-associated chemical entity mention (SACEM) class: abbreviation,
    family, formula, identifier, multiple, systematic and trivial. The
    difficulty and consistency of tagging chemicals in text was measured using
    an agreement study between annotators, obtaining a percentage agreement of
    91. For a subset of the CHEMDNER corpus (the test set of 3,000 abstracts)
    we provide not only the Gold Standard manual annotations, but also mentions
    automatically detected by the 26 teams that participated in the BioCreative
    IV CHEMDNER chemical mention recognition task. In addition, we release the
    CHEMDNER silver standard corpus of automatically extracted mentions from
    17,000 randomly selected PubMed abstracts. A version of the CHEMDNER corpus
    in the BioC format has been generated as well. We propose a standard for
    required minimum information about entity annotations for the construction
    of domain specific corpora on chemical and drug entities. The CHEMDNER
    corpus and annotation guidelines are available at:

Yet, a notable gap remains between the information stored in databases of curated knowledge and the plethora of interactions documented in the scientific literature.To bridge this gap, we introduce ComplexTome, a manually annotated corpus designed to facilitate the development of text-mining methods for the extraction of complex formation relationships among biomedical entities targeting the downstream semantics of the physical interaction subnetwork of the STRING database. This corpus comprises 1287 documents with ∼3500 relationships. We train a novel relation extraction model on this corpus and find that it can highly reliably identify physical protein interactions (F1-score = 82.8\\%). We additionally enhance the model’s capabilities through unsupervised trigger word detection and apply it to extract relations and trigger words for these relations from all open publications in the domain literature. This information has been fully integrated into the latest version of the STRING database.We provide the corpus, code, and all results produced by the large-scale runs of our systems biomedical on literature via Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8139716, Github https://github.com/farmeh/ComplexTome\_extraction, and the latest version of STRING database https://string-db.org/.},

In this paper we describe an approach where a named-entity recognition system produces a first annotation and annotators revise this annotation using a web-based interface. The agreement figures achieved show that the inter-annotator agreement is much better than the agreement with the system provided annotations. The corpus has been annotated for drugs, disorders, genes and their inter-relationships. For each of the drug–disorder, drug–target, and target–disorder relations three experts have annotated a set of 100 abstracts. These annotated relationships will be used to train and evaluate text-mining software to capture these relationships in texts.}

    and methods We selected text units from different parallel corpora (Medline abstract titles, drug labels,
    biomedical patent claims) in English, French, German, Spanish, and Dutch. Three annotators per language
    independently annotated the biomedical concepts, based on a subset of the Unified Medical Language System and
    covering a wide range of semantic groups. To reduce the annotation workload, automatically generated
    preannotations were provided. Individual annotations were automatically harmonized and then adjudicated, and
    cross-language consistency checks were carried out to arrive at the final annotations.Results The number of final
    annotations was 5530. Inter-annotator agreement scores indicate good agreement (median F-score 0.79), and are
    similar to those between individual annotators and the gold standard. The automatically generated harmonized
    annotation set for each language performed equally well as the best annotator for that language.Discussion The use
    of automatic preannotations, harmonized annotations, and parallel corpora helped to keep the manual annotation
    efforts manageable. The inter-annotator agreement scores provide a reference standard for gauging the performance
    of automatic annotation techniques.Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first gold-standard corpus for
    biomedical concept recognition in languages other than English. Other distinguishing features are the wide variety
    of semantic groups that are being covered, and the diversity of text genres that were annotated.}",

We assembled the entire corpus from 11 subcorpora covering various biological domains to achieve an overall subdomain-independent corpus. It consists of 3,308 MEDLINE abstracts with over 36k sentences and more than 960k tokens annotated with nearly 60k named entity mentions. Two annotators strove for carefully assigning entity mentions to classes of genes/proteins as well as families/groups, complexes, variants and enumerations of those where genes and proteins are represented by a single class. The main purpose of the corpus is to provide a large body of consistent and reliable annotations for supervised training and evaluation of machine learning algorithms in this relevant domain. Furthermore, we provide an evaluation of two state-of-the-art baseline systems {---} BioBert and flair {---} on the ProGene corpus. We make the evaluation datasets and the trained models available to encourage comparable evaluations of new methods in the future.",

There is a notable shortage of corpora designed to enhance the extraction of multiple types of relations, particularly focusing on proteins and protein-containing entities such as complexes and families, as well as chemicals. In this work, we present RegulaTome, a corpus that overcomes the limitations of several existing biomedical relation extraction (RE) corpora, many of which concentrate on single-type relations at the sentence level. RegulaTome stands out by offering 16 961 relations annotated in \&gt;2500 documents, making it the most extensive dataset of its kind to date. This corpus is specifically designed to cover a broader spectrum of \&gt;40 relation types beyond those traditionally explored, setting a new benchmark in the complexity and depth of biomedical RE tasks. Our corpus both broadens the scope of detected relations and allows for achieving noteworthy accuracy in RE. A transformer-based model trained on this corpus has demonstrated a promising F1-score (66.6\\%) for a task of this complexity, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in accurately identifying and categorizing a wide array of biological relations. This achievement highlights RegulaTome’s potential to significantly contribute to the development of more sophisticated, efficient, and accurate RE systems to tackle biomedical tasks. Finally, a run of the trained RE system on all PubMed abstracts and PMC Open Access full-text documents resulted in \&gt;18 million relations, extracted from the entire biomedical literature.},
